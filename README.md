Objective

Map and model how community investments (e.g., financial services, transit, public infrastructure) causally impact social outcomes (unemployment, education, crime), with a focus on historically underinvested neighborhoods. Deliver insights through GIS visualizations, predictive \& causal modeling, and an interactive dashboard for policymakers and investors.



Project Deliverables

Cleaned, integrated dataset with spatial and socioeconomic data



GIS maps of infrastructure, investments, and social outcomes



Predictive models for social outcomes



Causal inference models (using DoWhy) to quantify the causal effects of specific investments



Counterfactual simulations: What would happen if we increased investment in a given area?



Interactive dashboard for exploring data, predictions, causal impacts, and simulations



Consulting-style report with policy recommendations, equity analysis, and actionable insights



7-Day Plan with DoWhy Integration

Day	Task

Day 1	Define research questions and select city (NYC, Chicago, SF, Atlanta, LA). Gather data: demographics (ACS), financial access (FDIC), transit, parks, crime, education, municipal budgets



Day 2	Clean and preprocess datasets. Spatially join data to common geographies (census tracts/zip codes). Create initial investment and infrastructure indices



Day 3	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): GIS mapping of investment, opportunity gaps, and social outcomes. Identify high-need neighborhoods



Day 4	Build predictive models (e.g., linear regression, random forests) to predict outcomes like unemployment and crime from investment features



Day 5	Causal Inference with DoWhy:

\- Specify causal graph (DAG)

\- Identify confounders

\- Estimate causal effects of treatments (e.g., transit density, financial services) on outcomes

\- Validate with refutation tests

\- Run counterfactual simulations



Day 6	Develop interactive dashboard (Streamlit, Tableau, or Power BI) showing:

\- Investment \& outcome maps

\- Predictive model outputs

\- Causal impact estimates

\- Policy simulation tools



Day 7	Compile consulting report summarizing: methodology, key findings, causal effects, policy simulations, and recommendations. Finalize visual assets for portfolio/demo
